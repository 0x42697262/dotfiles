# INFOS

On `line 136`, I added an `opacity-rule` for `kitty` terminal. I think this can be used to add transparency for other programs as well like firefox.

On `line 163`, I used `dual_kawase` as the `blur-method` with the `blur-strength` of `2`. I have also set the `backed` to `glx` on `line 214`.

Also made some changes on `wintypes` but forgot what I have changed.

# Opacity Rule
`kitty`: `90%`
`obsidian`: `90%`
